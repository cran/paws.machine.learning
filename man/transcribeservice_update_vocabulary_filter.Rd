\title{Updates an existing custom vocabulary filter with a new list of words}
\usage{
transcribeservice_update_vocabulary_filter(
  VocabularyFilterName,
  Words = NULL,
  VocabularyFilterFileUri = NULL,
  DataAccessRoleArn = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{VocabularyFilterName}{[required] The name of the custom vocabulary filter you want to update. Custom
vocabulary filter names are case sensitive.}

\item{Words}{Use this parameter if you want to update your custom vocabulary filter
by including all desired terms, as comma-separated values, within your
request. The other option for updating your vocabulary filter is to save
your entries in a text file and upload them to an Amazon S3 bucket, then
specify the location of your file using the \code{VocabularyFilterFileUri}
parameter.

Note that if you include \code{Words} in your request, you cannot use
\code{VocabularyFilterFileUri}; you must choose one or the other.

Each language has a character set that contains all allowed characters
for that specific language. If you use unsupported characters, your
custom vocabulary filter request fails. Refer to \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/charsets.html}{Character Sets for Custom Vocabularies}
to get the character set for your language.}

\item{VocabularyFilterFileUri}{The Amazon S3 location of the text file that contains your custom
vocabulary filter terms. The URI must be located in the same Amazon Web
Services Region as the resource you're calling.

Here's an example URI path:
\verb{s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-vocab-filter-file.txt}

Note that if you include \code{VocabularyFilterFileUri} in your request, you
cannot use \code{Words}; you must choose one or the other.}

\item{DataAccessRoleArn}{The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that has permissions to
access the Amazon S3 bucket that contains your input files (in this
case, your custom vocabulary filter). If the role that you specify
doesnâ€™t have the appropriate permissions to access the specified Amazon
S3 location, your request fails.

IAM role ARNs have the format
\code{arn:partition:iam::account:role/role-name-with-path}. For example:
\verb{arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/Admin}.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-arns}{IAM ARNs}.}

\description{
Updates an existing custom vocabulary filter with a new list of words. The new list you provide overwrites all previous entries; you cannot append new terms onto an existing custom vocabulary filter.
