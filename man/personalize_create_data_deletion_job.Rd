\description{
Creates a batch job that deletes all references to specific users from an Amazon Personalize dataset group in batches. You specify the users to delete in a CSV file of userIds in an Amazon S3 bucket. After a job completes, Amazon Personalize no longer trains on the usersâ€™ data and no longer considers the users when generating user segments. For more information about creating a data deletion job, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/delete-records.html}{Deleting users}.
